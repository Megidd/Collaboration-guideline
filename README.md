# Collaboration guideline

Might be helpful for future developers working on this repository. 

## Passive vs active

* Be an active developer *not* passive
* Be **self-motivated**
* Don't wait for an issue to be assigned to you, but ...
  * ... think of new issues which can be opened
  * ... open an issue and check its priority with @Shahin
  * ... work on current open issues according to priority
* Seek comment on issues and PRs
  * Get help
* Be creative, discover issues
* Try to move quickly, be agile

## Creativity

* Come up with new ideas
   * Express them, even the ones which look stupid
   * Express ideas by opening issues on them
* Maybe a simple idea, inspires and sparks a better idea
* Ask hard questions
* Be curious

## Never say yes, unless ...

* Never say yes to anything unless you understand it totally
* Every yes is a debt you have to pay later
* Worst case scenario ...
  * ... is saying yes to something that everybody has a vague idea about it

## When you get stuck

* Provide details of
  * What is the problem?
  * Why that happened?
  * How are you trying to resolve it? The plan?
* Provide details by commenting on issues or PRs
* Maybe a colleague can give you a hand

## Sprint talk

* Don't skip talks, it might be offensive
  * Unless you give prior notice
* Don't be an absolute listener in talks, it might be offensive
  * What's the point of talk if you don't contribute
* Study agenda before talk
  * Prepare agenda if there is none
* Study relevant issues and PRs before talk
  * Don't attend talk with a blank mind
* Don't show signs of lack of interest or motivation
* Double-check priorities
  * A 10x developer is the one who knows what matters
* Make sure you're on the right track

## Always

* Each team member at any time ...
  * ... should be able to know what his/her teammates are working on ...
  * ... by looking at their issues and PRs

## Document everything

* Record your efforts
  * Later nobody remembers, even yourself
  
## Toxic environment

* Prevent a toxic environment
* Infighting and drama
    * Reduces productivity
    * Reduces mental strength
    * Increases mental noise
* Adopt collaboration rather than competition
* Avoid trying to prove yourself
* Don't take criticism personal

## Code quality and ethics

* Test
  * Try to follow test-driven development i.e. TDD
  * Code without tests [is bad code](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/718460)
  * Test and debug are the hard job
* API
  * Design and provide a proper API
  * Without a well-designed API, the code is useless
* Ethics
  * Code without test and API is a heavy burden on colleagues
